# Reposearch

## Instructions:
1. Create a simple application that utilizes APIs below on a fully responsive and cross browser compatible web page using HTML, CSS and Javascript. If developing for mobile (iOS / Android), please avoid developing on a webview and present your code on a native approach.
2. fork this repo, do your code, commit and push then send a link to your work. (github account is required.)

## Functional Requirements:
1. Users should be able to search for any public repository on github by name and display relevant information such as url, description, number of forks, number of stars and open issues.
2. open issues count should be clickable to display a different page with a table of all the open issues
3. clicking on an open issue should open a different page with all the information necessary
Bonus: create a visualization chart to display the records (preferrably animated)

## Rules/Pointers:
- there is no time limit. you can polish the application as you see fit before submitting.
- Any framework / libraries can be used to accomplish the task
- completed exam should be pushed through github on a public repo (you can delete after evaluation)

## Key Factors fo consider:
- clearly written code is a big plus
- use best practices to write code
- present the app in the best design possible
- we'll be looking at how you commit code
